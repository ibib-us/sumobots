""" pin assignments for this code

Motor 1 is the left motor
Motor 2 is the right motor
If your robot does move in the direction you expect just
switch the wires going to MA and MB for that motor on the MakerPi board.

MakerPi connections to sensors (ToF is VL53L0X sensor):

Grove 2
GND -> ToF Right GND
3V3 -> ToF Right VIN
GP2 -> ToF Right SDA
GP3  -> ToF Right SCL

Grove 3
GND -> IR Left GND
3V3 ->  IR Left VIN
GP4 -> ToF Left Xshut
GP5 -> IR Left DO

Grove 4
GND -> ToF Left GND 
3V3 -> ToF Left VCC
GP16 -> ToF Left SDA
GP17 -> ToF Left SCL

Grove 5
GND -> IR Right GND
3V3 -> IR Right VCC
GP6 -> ToF Right Xshut 
GP26 -> IR Right DO
